# Maze-Mapping
This is a program in C that computes the map for a robot with 4 sensors navigating in an unknown maze. The maze is generated as a 2 dimensional one. A maze cell can be wall or an open space and naturally the robot can navigate within open spaces. Can be later used in maze solving robot project with the implementations of search algorithms.
